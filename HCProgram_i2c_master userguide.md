### Configuration example of dts

    i2c@3{
        pinmux-active = <104 2 105 2>;
        devpath = "/dev/i2c3";
        baudrate = <100000>;
        mode = "master";
        status = "okay";
    };

pinmux-active: the pin used by i2c. 104: I2C_SCL pin; 105: I2C_SDA pin. 2 Configure this pin to use the I2C function.
devpath: The path generated by the device node.
baudrate： i2c baud rate, support 100k/200k/400k
mode: i2c device mode, here is "master".
status: okay means enabled, disable means disabled.

### i2c device configuration example

Take the lt8918 device as an example.

    lt8918 {
    	i2c-devpath = "/dev/i2c3";
    	i2c-addr = <addr>;
    	reset-gpio = <PINPAD_L25 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
    	status = "okay";
    };

lt8918 is the device node name;
i2c-devpath is the i2c used by the device; it corresponds to the devpath in the i2c@3 node above;
i2c-addr is the address of the device;
reset-gpio is the pin configuration used by the device;
status is the state of the lt8918 node, it is okay when it is turned on, and it is disabled when it is turned off;
