When debugging hcrtos, sometimes it crashes, but you can still jtag attach. At this time, there are the following methods to view the call stack of each task:

1. Check the linked list headers of all tasks in the Watch window, and get the linked list of tasks (global variable gTCBHead), which is a one-way linked list, and find the pTCB of the task you want to see.

2. Find the `pxTopofSTack` and `pxEndofSTack` of this task.

3. Dump the memory at the address of `pxTopOfStack`, the length is `(pxEndOfStack - pxTopOfStack)`, save it as a binary file, such as stack.bin

4. Run `stack_probe` on the Linux PC. The first parameter: `-o xxx.out` (the firmware .out file generated by compilation); the second parameter: `-s stack.bin` (the stack dumped from the third step); Three parameters `-t 0x81506ed8` (ie `pxTopOfStack`) `./stack_probe -o hcdemo.out -s stack.bin -t 0x81506ed8` `__text_start is 0x80001000` `__text_end is 0x80439670` `__entry is 0x80001000`
